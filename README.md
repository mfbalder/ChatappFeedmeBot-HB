# ChatThing

For this project, I wanted to get a better understanding of what websockets were and how they were used, particularly in the context of a chat application. ChatThing is a web-based instant messenging app that allows users to login and have separate conversations with other logged-in users in real time.

Technologies Researched/Used:
* C-based Languages (Python)
* Web Frameworks (Flask)
* Websockets (Flask-SocketIO)
* JQuery
* Encryption (JSEncrypt)
* HTML/CSS
* Jinja
